# üçú üç• Case Study #1: Danny's Diner

### **1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**
``` sql
SELECT
	CASE
		WHEN customer_id = 'A' THEN 'Customer A'
		WHEN customer_id = 'B' THEN 'Customer B'
		WHEN customer_id = 'C' THEN 'Customer C'
		ELSE customer_id
    END AS Customers, 
	'$' + CAST(SUM(menu.price) AS varchar) AS Amount_Spent
FROM 
	[dannys_diner].[sales]
LEFT JOIN 
	[dannys_diner].[menu]
ON 
	[dannys_diner].[sales].product_id = [dannys_diner].[menu].product_id
GROUP BY 
	customer_id
ORDER BY 
	customer_id;

Answer:
| Customers	  | Amount_Spent |
 ------------ | -------------|
| Customer A  |     $76      |
| Customer B  |     $74      |
| Customer C  |     $36      |

Steps:
- Use JOIN to merge sales and menu tables as customer_id is from the sales table and price is from the menu table.
- Use SUM and GROUP BY to find out total_sales contributed by each customer.
